\chapter{Introduction}
Deep Learning popularity grew increasingly in the past years because of its various applications. However, with its growth increased also a demand for data as AI tasks require a higher number of information to learn. A higher number is needed to eliminate the common mistakes deep learning can make because of its lack of prior knowledge of relations and rules. To prevent that the known deep learning technics are getting equipped with external structures. One of them is the region-based embeddings. It defines the relations and influence between the regions. It can improve many different tasks like language processing, object classification, or voice recognition. Therefore, to explain and show how it works we propose the tool to visualize the high-dimensional Ball embeddings which preserve the topological relations in 2d. For easier availability, we created our visualization as a web service. It provides different approaches to look at regional embeddings: path tracking diagram, relational ball diagram, and construction process of ball-embeddings.
